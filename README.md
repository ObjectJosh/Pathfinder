In this program, I use "ray casting" to cast vectors in a 2D space from the origin of an object. This program displays the usage of ray casting through casting lines which act as a light source, upon objects â€” if there are multiple objects in the ray's direction, the light is casted on only the closest object, due to the concept of solid objects and shadows. In addition, the program calculates the longest ray, or distance, from the object of the rays casted from the object's field of view. It then moves toward that point, creating an artificially intelligent path finder to navigate through a two-dimensional space. To implement collisions, the program also uses ray casting to calculate the distance to the closest wall, or the ray's length. If you would like additional information on ray casting, please feel free to visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting#:~:text=Ray%20casting%20is%20the%20use,rendering%20constructive%20solid%20geometry%20models.
